		</div>
		<div class= "col-sm-4">
			<h3>2nd example hello world</h3>
			<p>We have added two new things from the last example, and kept two things:<br>
				• The AngularJS source code is still the same. The ng-app directive has moved to the body tag.<br>
				• We have an input tag, with a directive called ng-model on it. The ng-model directive
				is used with input fields whenever we want the user to enter any data and get access
				to the value in JavaScript. Here, we tell AngularJS to store the value that the user
				types into this field in a variable called name.<br>
				• We also have another directive called ng-bind. ng-bind and the double-curly notation
				are interchangeable, so instead of ""span ng-bind="name">/span>, we
				could have written {{ name }}. Both accomplish the same thing, which is putting
				the value of the variable name inside the tag, and keeping it up to date if it changes.</p>
			<input type="text"
				ng-model="name"
				placeholder="Enter your name">

			<h3>Usage of this keyword and self variable</h3>
			<p>What has changed here?<br>
			• We now have only one binding, which is in the ctrl.message variable.<br>
			• There is a button with the label “Change Message.” There is a built-in directive on
			it, ng-click, to which we pass a function as an argument. The ng-click directive
			evaluates any expression passed to it when the button is clicked. In this case, we tell
			AngularJS to trigger the controller’s changeMessage() function.<br>
			• The changeMessage() function in the controller sets the value of message to
			“Goodbye.”<br>
			• Also, as good practice, we avoid referring to the this keyword inside the controller,
			preferring to use a proxy self variable, which points to this. The following note
			has more information on why this is recommended.</p>
			{{ctrl.message}} AngularJS.
			<button ng-click="ctrl.changeMessage()">Change Message</button>

			<h3>example of ng-repeat</h3>
			<p>In our HTML, we used a directive called ng-repeat. ng-repeat is one of the most
			versatile and heavily used directives of AngularJS, because it allows us to iterate over an
			array or over the keys and values of an object and display them in the HTML.</p>
